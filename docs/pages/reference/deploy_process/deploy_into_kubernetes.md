werf is a compatible alternative to [Helm 2](https://helm.sh), which uses improved deploy process.

werf has 2 main commands to work with Kubernetes: [deploy]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/cli/main/deploy.html) — to install or upgrade app in the cluster, and [dismiss]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/cli/main/dismiss.html)  — to uninstall app from cluster.

Deployed resources are tracked with different configurable modes, logs and Kubernetes events are shown for the resources, images built by werf are integrated into deploy configuration [templates](#templates) seamlessly. werf can set arbitrary annotations and labels to all Kubernetes resources of the project being deployed.

Configuration is described with Helm compatible [chart](#chart).

## Chart

The chart is a collection of configuration files which describe an application. Chart files reside in the `.helm` directory in the root directory of the project:

```
.helm/
  templates/
    <name>.yaml
    <name>.tpl
  charts/
  secret/
  values.yaml
  secret-values.yaml
```

### Templates

Templates are placed in the `.helm/templates` directory.

Directory contains YAML files `*.yaml`. Each YAML file describes one or several Kubernetes resources specs separated by three hyphens `---`, for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mydeploy
  labels:
    service: mydeploy
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      service: mydeploy
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        service: mydeploy
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: main
        image: ubuntu:18.04
        command: [ "/bin/bash", "-c", "while true; do date ; sleep 1 ; done" ]
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: mycm
  data:
    node.conf: |
      port 6379
      loglevel notice
```

Each YAML file also preprocessed using [Go templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#hdr-Actions).

With go templates user can:
 * generate different Kubernetes specs for different cases;
 * parametrize templates with [values](#values) for different environments;
 * define common text parts as named Go templates and reuse them in several places;
 * etc.

[Sprig functions](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) and [advanced functions](https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/), like `include` and `required`, can be used in templates.

Also user can place `*.tpl` files, which will not be rendered into Kubernetes specs. These files can be used to store arbitrary custom Go templates and definitions. All templates and definitions from `*.tpl` files will be available for the use in the `*.yaml` files.

#### Integration with built images

To use docker images in the chart resources specs user must specify full docker images names including docker repo and docker tag. But how to specify images from `werf.yaml` given that full docker images names for these images depends on the selected tagging strategy and specified images repo?

The second question is how to use [`imagePullPolicy` Kubernetes parameter](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#updating-images) together with images from `werf.yaml`: should user set `imagePullPolicy` to `Always`, how to pull images only when there is a need to pull?

To answer these questions werf has runtime functions, `werf_container_image` and `werf_container_env`.  User must use these template functions to specify images from `werf.yaml` in the chart templates safely and correctly.

##### werf_container_image

The template function generates `image` and `imagePullPolicy` keys for the pod container.

A specific feature of the function is that `imagePullPolicy` is generated based on the `.Values.global.werf.is_branch` value, if tags are used, `imagePullPolicy: Always` is not set. So in the result images are pulled always only for the images tagged by git-branch names (because docker image id can be changed for the same docker image name).

The function may return multiple strings, which is why it must be used together with the `indent` construction.

The logic of generating the `imagePullPolicy` key:
* The `.Values.global.werf.is_branch=true` value means that an image is being deployed based on the `latest` logic for a branch.
  * In this case, the image for an appropriate docker tag must be updated through docker pull, even if it already exists, to get the current `latest` version of the respective tag.
  * In this case – `imagePullPolicy=Always`.
* The `.Values.global.werf.is_branch=false` value means that a tag or a specific image commit is being deployed.
  * In this case, the image for an appropriate docker tag doesn't need to be updated through docker pull if it already exists.
  * In this case, `imagePullPolicy` is not specified, which is consistent with the default value currently adopted in Kubernetes: `imagePullPolicy=IfNotPresent`.

> The images tagged by custom tag strategy (`--tag-custom`) processed like the images tagged by git branch tag strategy (`--tag-git-branch`)

An example of using the function in the case when a **named** image (or multiple images) used in the `werf.yaml` config:
* `tuple <image-name> . | werf_container_image | indent <N-spaces>`

An example of using the function in the case when a single **unnamed** image used in the `werf.yaml` config:
* `tuple . | werf_container_image | indent <N-spaces>`
* `werf_container_image . | indent <N-spaces>` (additional simplified entry format)

##### werf_container_env

Enables streamlining the release process if the image remains unchanged. Generates a block with the `DOCKER_IMAGE_ID` environment variable for the pod container. Image id will be set to real value only if `.Values.global.werf.is_branch=true`, because in this case the image for an appropriate docker tag might have been updated through its name remained unchanged. The `DOCKER_IMAGE_ID` variable contains a new id docker for an image, which forces Kubernetes to update an asset. The template may return multiple strings, which is why it must be used together with `indent`.

> The images tagged by custom tag strategy (`--tag-custom`) processed like the images tagged by git branch tag strategy (`--tag-git-branch`)

An example of using the function in the case when a **named** image (or multiple images) used in the `werf.yaml` config:
* `tuple <image-name> . | werf_container_env | indent <N-spaces>`

An example of using the function in the case when a single **unnamed** image used in the `werf.yaml` config:
* `tuple . | werf_container_env | indent <N-spaces>`
* `werf_container_env . | indent <N-spaces>` (additional simplified entry format)

##### Examples

To specify image named `backend` from `werf.yaml`:

{% raw %}
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backend
  labels:
    service: backend
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      service: backend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        service: backend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: main
        command: [ ... ]
{{ tuple "backend" . | werf_container_image | indent 8 }}
        env:
{{ tuple "backend" . | werf_container_env | indent 8 }}
```
{% endraw %}

To specify single unnamed image from `werf.yaml`:

{% raw %}
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backend
  labels:
    service: backend
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      service: backend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        service: backend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: main
        command: [ ... ]
{{ werf_container_image . | indent 8 }}
        env:
{{ werf_container_env . | indent 8 }}
```
{% endraw %}

#### Secret files

Secret files are useful to store sensitive data such as certificates and private keys directly in the project repo.

Secret files are placed in the directory `.helm/secret`. User can create arbitrary files structure in this directory. To encrypt your files [see article about secrets]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/deploy_process/working_with_secrets.html#secret-file-encryption).

##### werf_secret_file

`werf_secret_file` is runtime template function helper for user to fetch secret file content in chart templates.
This template function reads file context, which usually placed in the resource yaml manifest of such resources as Secrets.
Template function requires relative path to the file inside `.helm/secret` directory as an argument.

For example to read `.helm/secret/backend-saml/stage/tls.key` and `.helm/secret/backend-saml/stage/tls.crt` files decrypted content into templates:

{% raw %}
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: myproject-backend-saml
type: kubernetes.io/tls
data:
  tls.crt: {{ werf_secret_file "backend-saml/stage/tls.crt" | b64enc }}
  tls.key: {{ werf_secret_file "backend-saml/stage/tls.key" | b64enc }}
```
{% endraw %}

Note that `backend-saml/stage/` — is an arbitrary files structure, user can place all files into single directory `.helm/secret` or create subdirectories on own needs.

#### Builtin templates and params

{% raw %}
 * `{{ .Chart.Name }}` — contains [project name] from `werf.yaml` config.
 * `{{ .Release.Name }}` — contains [release name](#release).
 * `{{ .Files.Get }}` — function to read file content into templates, requires file path argument. Path should be relative to `.helm` directory (files outside `.helm` cannot be used).
{% endraw %}

### Values

Values is an arbitrary yaml map, filled with the parameters, which can be used in [templates](#templates).

There are different types of values in the werf:

 * User defined regular values.
 * User defined secret values.
 * Service values.

#### User defined regular values

Place user defined regular values into the chart file `.helm/values.yaml` (which is optional). For example:

```yaml
global:
  names:
  - alpha
  - beta
  - gamma
  mysql:
    staging:
      user: mysql-staging
    production:
      user: mysql-production
    _default:
      user: mysql-dev
      password: mysql-dev
```

Values placed by key `global` will be available in the current chart and all [subcharts]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/deploy_process/working_with_chart_dependencies.html).

Values placed by arbitrary key `SOMEKEY` will be available in the current chart and in the [subchart]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/deploy_process/working_with_chart_dependencies.html) with the name `SOMEKEY`.

File `.helm/values.yaml` is the default values file. Additional user defined regular values can alternatively be passed via:

 * Separate values files by specifying werf options `--values=PATH_TO_FILE` (can be used multiple times to pass multiple files).
 * Set options `--set key1.key2.key3.array[0]=one`, `--set key1.key2.key3.array[1]=two` (can be used multiple times, see also `--set-string key=forced_string_value`).

#### User defined secret values

Secret values are useful to store passwords and other sensitive data directly in the project repo.

Place user defined secret values into the chart file `.helm/secret-values.yaml` (which is optional). For example:

```yaml
global:
  mysql:
    production:
      password: 100024fe29e45bf00665d3399f7545f4af63f09cc39790c239e16b1d597842161123
    staging:
      password: 100024fe29e45bf00665d3399f7545f4af63f09cc39790c239e16b1d597842161123
```

Each value like `100024fe29e45bf00665d3399f7545f4af63f09cc39790c239e16b1d597842161123` in the secret values map is a werf secret encoded value. Otherwise secret values map is the same as a regular values map. See more info [about secret values generation and working with secrets]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/deploy_process/working_with_secrets.html#secret-values-encryption).

File `.helm/secret-values.yaml` is the default secret values file. Additional user defined secret values can alternatively be passed via separate secret values files by specifying werf options `--secret-values=PATH_TO_FILE` (can be used multiple times to pass multiple files).

#### Service values

Service values are generated by werf automatically to pass additional werf service info when rendering chart templates.

Complete example of service values:

```yaml
global:
  env: stage
  namespace: myapp-stage
  werf:
    ci:
      branch: mybranch
      is_branch: true
      is_tag: false
      tag: '"-"'
    docker_tag: mybranch
    image:
      assets:
        docker_image: registry.domain.com/apps/myapp/assets:mybranch
        docker_image_id: sha256:ddaec322ee2c622aa0591177062a81009d9e52785be6915c5a37e822c2019755
        docker_image_digest: sha256:81009d9e52785be6915c5a37e822c2019755ddaec322ee2c622aa0591177062a
      rails:
        docker_image: registry.domain.com/apps/myapp/rails:mybranch
        docker_image_id: sha256:646c56c828beaf26e67e84a46bcdb6ab555c6bce8ebeb066b79a9075d0e87f50
        docker_image_digest: sha256:555c6bce8ebeb066b79a9075d0e87f50646c56c828beaf26e67e84a46bcdb6ab
    is_nameless_image: false
    name: myapp
    repo: registry.domain.com/apps/myapp
```

There are following service values:
 * Environment being used during deploy: `.Values.global.env`.
 * Kubernetes namespace being used during deploy: `.Values.global.namespace`.
 * Git branch name or git tag name used: `.Values.global.werf.ci.is_branch`, `.Values.global.werf.ci.branch`, `.Values.global.werf.ci.is_tag`, `.Values.global.werf.ci.tag`.
 * `.Values.global.ci.ref` is set to either git branch name or git tag name.
 * Full docker images names and ids for each image from `werf.yaml` config: `.Values.global.werf.image.IMAGE_NAME.docker_image`, `.Values.global.werf.image.IMAGE_NAME.docker_image_id` and `.Values.global.werf.image.IMAGE_NAME.docker_image_digest`.
 * `.Values.global.werf.is_nameless_image` indicates whether there is the nameless image defined in the `werf.yaml` config.
 * Project name from `werf.yaml`: `.Values.global.werf.name`.
 * Docker tag being used during deploy for images from `werf.yaml` (accordingly to the selected tagging strategy): `.Values.global.werf.docker_tag`.
 * Images repo being used during deploy: `.Values.global.werf.repo`.

#### Merge result values

During deploy process werf merges all of user defined regular, user defined secret and service values into the single values map, which is passed to templates rendering engine to be used in the templates (see [how to use values in the templates](#using-values-in-the-templates)). Values are merged in the following order of priority (next values overwrite previous):

 1. User defined regular values from `.helm/values.yaml`.
 2. User defined regular values from all cli options `--values=PATH_TO_FILE` in the order of specification.
 3. User defined secret values from `.helm/secret-values.yaml`.
 4. User defined secret values from all cli options `--secret-values=PATH_TO_FILE` in the order of specification.
 5. Service values.

### Using values in the templates

To access values from chart templates following syntax is used:

{% raw %}
```yaml
{{ .Values.key.key.arraykey[INDEX].key }}
```
{% endraw %}

`.Values` object contains [merged result values](#merge-result-values) map.

## Release

While chart is a collection of configuration files of your application, release is a runtime object representing running instance of your application deployed with werf.

Each release have a single name and multiple versions. On each werf deploy invocation a new release version is created.

### Releases storage

Each release version is stored in the Kubernetes cluster itself. werf can store releases in ConfigMaps or Secrets in arbitrary namespaces.

By default werf stores releases in the ConfigMaps in the `kube-system` namespace to be fully compatible with [Helm 2](https://helm.sh) default installations. Releases storage can be configured by werf deploy cli options: `--helm-release-storage-namespace=NS` and `--helm-release-storage-type=configmap|secret`.

The command [werf helm list]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/cli/management/helm/list.html) can be used to list releases created with werf. Also, user can fetch history of certain release with command [werf helm history]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/cli/management/helm/history.html).

#### Helm compatibility notice

werf is fully compatible with already existing Helm 2 installations as long as releases storage is configured the same way as in helm. User might need to configure release storage with options `--helm-release-storage-namespace` and `--helm-release-storage-type` if existing helm installation uses non default releases storage.

Releases created by werf can be inspected and viewed with helm commands, such as `helm list` and `helm get`. werf can also upgrade already existing releases originally created by helm.

Furthermore werf and Helm 2 installation could work in the same cluster at the same time.

### Environment

By default werf assumes that each release should be tainted with some environment, such as `staging`, `test` or `production`.

Based on the environment werf will determine:

 1. Release name.
 2. Kubernetes namespace.

Environment is a required parameter for deploy and should be specified either with option `--env` or automatically determined for the used CI/CD system, see [CI/CD configuration integration]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/plugging_into_cicd/overview.html#cicd-configuration-integration) for more info.

### Release name

By default release name will be constructed by template `[[ project ]]-[[ env ]]`. Where `[[ project ]]` refers to the [project name]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/configuration/introduction.html#project-name) and `[[ env ]]` refers to the specified or detected environment.

For example for project named `symfony-demo` there will be following Helm Release names depending on the specified environment:
* `symfony-demo-stage` for the `stage` environment;
* `symfony-demo-test` for the `test` environment;
* `symfony-demo-prod` for the `prod` environment.

Release name could be redefined by deploy option `--release NAME`. In that case werf will use specified name as is.

Custom release name can also be defined in the werf.yaml configuration [by setting `deploy.helmRelease`]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/configuration/deploy_into_kubernetes.html#release-name).

#### Release name slug

Helm Release name constructed by template will be slugified to fit release name requirements by [*release slug procedure*]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/toolbox/slug.html#basic-algorithm), which generates unique valid Helm Release name.

This is default behaviour, which can be disabled by [setting `deploy.helmReleaseSlug=false`]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/configuration/deploy_into_kubernetes.html#release-name).

### Kubernetes namespace

By default Kubernetes Namespace will be constructed by template `[[ project ]]-[[ env ]]`. Where `[[ project ]]` refers to the [project name]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/configuration/introduction.html#meta-config-section) and `[[ env ]]` refers to the determined environment.

For example for project named `symfony-demo` there will be following Kubernetes Namespaces depending on the specified environment:
* `symfony-demo-stage` for the `stage` environment;
* `symfony-demo-test` for the `test` environment;
* `symfony-demo-prod` for the `prod` environment.

Kubernetes Namespace could be redefined by deploy option `--namespace NAMESPACE`. In that case werf will use specified name as is.

Custom Kubernetes Namespace can also be defined in the werf.yaml configuration [by setting `deploy.namespace`]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/configuration/deploy_into_kubernetes.html#kubernetes-namespace).

#### Kubernetes namespace slug

Kubernetes Namespace constructed by template will be slugified to fit [DNS Label](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt) requirements by [*namespace slug procedure*]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/toolbox/slug.html#basic-algorithm), which generates unique valid Kubernetes Namespace.

This is default behaviour, which can be disabled by [setting `deploy.namespaceSlug=false`]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/configuration/deploy_into_kubernetes.html#kubernetes-namespace).

## Deploy process

When running `werf deploy` command werf starts deploy process which includes following steps:

 1. Render chart templates into single list of Kubernetes resources manifests and validate them.
 2. Run `pre-install` or `pre-upgrade` [hooks](#helm-hooks) and track each of the hooks till successful or failed termination printing logs and other info along the way.
 3. Apply changes to Kubernetes resources: create new, delete old, update existing.
 4. Create new release version and save current resources manifests state into this release.
 5. Track all release resources till readiness state reached printing logs and other info along the way.
 6. Run `post-install` or `post-upgrade` [hooks](#helm-hooks) and track each of the hooks till successful or failed termination printing logs and other info along the way.

NOTE: werf will delete all newly created resources immediately during current deploy process if this deploy process fails at any step specified above!

During execution of helm hooks on the steps 2 and 6 werf will track these hooks resources until successful termination. Tracking [can be configured](#resource-tracking-configuration) for each hook resource.

On the step 5 werf tracks all release resources until each resource reaches "ready" state. All resources are tracked at the same time. During tracking werf unifies info from all release resources in realtime into single text output and periodically prints so called status progress table. Tracking [can be configured](#resource-tracking-configuration) for each resource.

werf shows logs of resources Pods only until pod reaches "ready" state, except for Jobs. For Pods of a Job logs will be shown till Pods are terminated.

Internally [kubedog library](https://github.com/flant/kubedog) is used to track resources. Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets and Jobs are supported for tracking now. Service, Ingress, PVC and other are [soon to come](https://github.com/werf/werf/issues/1637).

### Method of applying changes

werf tries to use 3-way-merge patches to update resources in the Kubernetes cluster, which is the best option. However there are different resource update methods are available.

See more info in the articles:
 - [resources update methods and adoption]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/deploy_process/resources_update_methods_and_adoption.html);
 - [differences with helm resources update method]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/deploy_process/differences_with_helm.html#three-way-merge-patches-and-resources-adoption);
 - ["3-way merge in werf: deploying to Kubernetes via Helm “on steroids” medium article](https://medium.com/flant-com/3-way-merge-patches-helm-werf-beb7eccecdfe).

### If deploy failed

In the case of failure during release process werf will create a new release in the FAILED state. This state can then be inspected by the user to find the problem and solve it in the next deploy invocation.

Then on the next deploy invocation werf will rollback release to the last successful version. During rollback all release resources will be restored to the last successful version state before applying any new changes to the resources manifests.

This rollback step is needed now and will be passed away when [3-way-merge method of applying changes](#method-of-applying-changes) will be implemented.

### Helm hooks

The helm hook is arbitrary Kubernetes resource marked with special annotation `helm.sh/hook`. For example:

```yaml
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: somejob
  annotations:
    "helm.sh/hook": pre-upgrade,pre-install
    "helm.sh/hook-weight": "1"
```

There are a lot of different helm hooks which come into play during deploy process. We have already seen `pre|post-install|upgrade` hooks in the [deploy process](#deploy-process), which are the most usually needed hooks to run such tasks as migrations (in `pre-upgrade` hooks) or some post deploy actions. The full list of available hooks can be found in the [helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/).

Hooks are sorted in the ascending order specified by `helm.sh/hook-weight` annotation (hooks with the same weight are sorted by the names), then created and executed sequentially. werf recreates Kubernetes resource for each of the hook in the case when resource already exists in the cluster. Hooks Kubernetes resources are not deleted after execution.

### Resource tracking configuration

Tracking can be configured for each resource using resource annotations:

 * [`werf.io/track-termination-mode`](#track-termination-mode);
 * [`werf.io/fail-mode`](#fail-mode);
 * [`werf.io/failures-allowed-per-replica`](#failures-allowed-per-replica);
 * [`werf.io/log-regex`](#log-regex);
 * [`werf.io/log-regex-for-CONTAINER_NAME`](#log-regex-for-container);
 * [`werf.io/skip-logs`](#skip-logs);
 * [`werf.io/skip-logs-for-containers`](#skip-logs-for-containers);
 * [`werf.io/show-logs-only-for-containers`](#show-logs-only-for-containers);
 * [`werf.io/show-service-messages`](#show-service-messages).

All of these annotations can be combined and used together for resource.

**TIP** Use `"werf.io/track-termination-mode": NonBlocking` and `"werf.io/fail-mode": IgnoreAndContinueDeployProcess` when you need to define a Job in the release, that runs in background and does not affect deploy process.

**TIP** Use `"werf.io/track-termination-mode": NonBlocking` when you need a StatefulSet with `OnDelete` manual update strategy, but you don't need to block deploy process till StatefulSet is updated immediately.

#### Examples of using annotations

<div class="tabs">
  <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tabs__btn active" onclick="openTab(event, 'tabs__btn', 'tabs__content', 'show-service-messages')">show-service-messages</a>
  <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tabs__btn" onclick="openTab(event, 'tabs__btn', 'tabs__content', 'skip-logs')">skip-logs</a>
  <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tabs__btn" onclick="openTab(event, 'tabs__btn', 'tabs__content', 'track-termination-mode')">NonBlocking track-termination-mode</a>
</div>
<div id="show-service-messages" class="tabs__content active">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flant/werf-demos/master/deploy/werf-new-track-modes-1.gif" />
</div>
<div id="skip-logs" class="tabs__content">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flant/werf-demos/master/deploy/werf-new-track-modes-2.gif" />
</div>
<div id="track-termination-mode" class="tabs__content">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flant/werf-demos/master/deploy/werf-new-track-modes-3.gif" />
</div>

#### Track termination mode

`"werf.io/track-termination-mode": WaitUntilResourceReady|NonBlocking`

 * `WaitUntilResourceReady` (default) — specifies to block whole deploy process till each resource with this track termination mode is ready.
 * `NonBlocking` — specifies to track this resource only until there are other resources not ready yet.

#### Fail mode

`"werf.io/fail-mode": FailWholeDeployProcessImmediately|HopeUntilEndOfDeployProcess|IgnoreAndContinueDeployProcess`

 * `FailWholeDeployProcessImmediately` (default) — fail whole deploy process when error occurred for resource.
 * `HopeUntilEndOfDeployProcess` — when error occurred for resource set this resource into "hope" mode and continue tracking other resources. When all of remained resources has become ready or all of remained resources are in the "hope" mode, transit resource back to "normal" mode and fail whole deploy process when error occurred for this resource once again.
 * `IgnoreAndContinueDeployProcess` — resource errors does not affect deploy process.

#### Failures allowed per replica

`"werf.io/failures-allowed-per-replica": "NUMBER"`

By default 1 failure per replica is allowed before considering whole deploy process as failed. This setting is related to [fail mode](#fail-mode): it defines a threshold before fail mode comes into play.

#### Log regex

`"werf.io/log-regex": RE2_REGEX`

Defines a [Re2 regex](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) that applies to all logs of all containers of all Pods owned by resource with this annotation. werf will show only those log lines that fit specified regex. By default werf will show all log lines.

#### Log regex for container

`"werf.io/log-regex-for-CONTAINER_NAME": RE2_REGEX`

Defines a [Re2 regex](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) that applies to logs of specified container by name `CONTAINER_NAME` of all Pods owned by resource with this annotation. werf will show only those log lines that fit specified regex. By default werf will show all log lines.

#### Skip logs

`"werf.io/skip-logs": "true"|"false"`

Set to `"true"` to suppress all logs of all containers of all Pods owned by resource with this annotation. Annotation is disabled by default.

#### Skip logs for containers

`"werf.io/skip-logs-for-containers": CONTAINER_NAME1,CONTAINER_NAME2,CONTAINER_NAME3...`

Comma-separated list of containers names of all Pods owned by resource with this annotation for which werf should fully suppress log output.

#### Show logs only for containers

`"werf.io/show-logs-only-for-containers": CONTAINER_NAME1,CONTAINER_NAME2,CONTAINER_NAME3...`

Comman-separated list on containers names of all Pods owned by resource with this annotation for which werf should show logs. Logs of containers not specified in this list will be suppressed. By default werf shows logs of all containers of all Pods of resource.

#### Show service messages

`"werf.io/show-service-messages": "true"|"false"`

Set to `"true"` to enable additional debug info for resource including Kubernetes events in realtime text stream during tracking. By default werf will show these service messages only when this resource has failed whole deploy process.

### Annotate and label chart resources

#### Auto annotations

werf automatically sets following builtin annotations to all chart resources deployed:

 * `"werf.io/version": FULL_WERF_VERSION` — werf version that being used when running `werf deploy` command;
 * `"project.werf.io/name": PROJECT_NAME` — project name specified in the `werf.yaml`;
 * `"project.werf.io/env": ENV` — environment name specified with `--env` param or `WERF_ENV` variable; optional, will not be set if env is not used.

werf also sets auto annotations with info from the used CI/CD system (GitLab CI for example)  when using `werf ci-env` command prior to run `werf deploy` command. For example [`project.werf.io/git`]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/plugging_into_cicd/gitlab_ci.html#werf_add_annotation_project_git), [`ci.werf.io/commit`]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/plugging_into_cicd/gitlab_ci.html#werf_add_annotation_ci_commit), [`gitlab.ci.werf.io/pipeline-url`]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/plugging_into_cicd/gitlab_ci.html#werf_add_annotation_gitlab_ci_pipeline_url) and [`gitlab.ci.werf.io/job-url`]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/plugging_into_cicd/gitlab_ci.html#werf_add_annotation_gitlab_ci_job_url).

 * [plugging into GitLab CI]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/plugging_into_cicd/gitlab_ci.html).

#### Custom annotations and labels

User can pass arbitrary additional annotations and labels using cli options `--add-annotation annoName=annoValue` (can be specified multiple times) and `--add-label labelName=labelValue` (can be specified multiple times) for werf deploy invocation.

For example, to set annotations and labels `commit-sha=9aeee03d607c1eed133166159fbea3bad5365c57`, `gitlab-user-email=vasya@myproject.com` to all Kubernetes resources from chart use following werf deploy invocation:

```shell
werf deploy \
  --add-annotation "commit-sha=9aeee03d607c1eed133166159fbea3bad5365c57" \
  --add-label "commit-sha=9aeee03d607c1eed133166159fbea3bad5365c57" \
  --add-annotation "gitlab-user-email=vasya@myproject.com" \
  --add-label "gitlab-user-email=vasya@myproject.com" \
  --env dev \
  --images-repo :minikube \
  --stages-storage :local
```

### Resources manifests validation

If resource manifest in the chart contains logical or syntax errors then werf will write validation warning to the output during deploy process. Also all validation errors will be written to the `debug.werf.io/validation-messages`. These errors typically does not affect deploy process exit status, because Kubernetes apiserver can accept wrong manifests with certain typos or errors without reporting errors.

For example, having following typos in the chart templates (`envs` instead of `env` and `redinessProbe` instead of `readinessProbe`):

```
containers:
- name: main
  command: [ "/bin/bash", "-c", "while true; do date ; sleep 1 ; done" ]
  image: ubuntu:18.04
  redinessProbe:
    tcpSocket:
      port: 8080
    initialDelaySeconds: 5
    periodSeconds: 10
envs:
- name: MYVAR
  value: myvalue
```

Validation output will be like:

```
│   WARNING ### Following problems detected during deploy process ###
│   WARNING Validation of target data failed: deployment/mydeploy1: [ValidationError(Deployment.spec.template.spec.containers[0]): unknown field               ↵
│ "redinessProbe" in io.k8s.api.core.v1.Container, ValidationError(Deployment.spec.template.spec): unknown field "envs" in io.k8s.api.core.v1.PodSpec]
```

And resource will contain `debug.werf.io/validation-messages` annotation:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    debug.werf.io/validation-messages: 'Validation of target data failed: deployment/mydeploy1:
      [ValidationError(Deployment.spec.template.spec.containers[0]): unknown field
      "redinessProbe" in io.k8s.api.core.v1.Container, ValidationError(Deployment.spec.template.spec):
      unknown field "envs" in io.k8s.api.core.v1.PodSpec]'
...
```

## Multiple Kubernetes clusters

There are cases when separate Kubernetes clusters are needed for a different environments. You can [configure access to multiple clusters](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters) using kube contexts in a single kube config.

In that case deploy option `--kube-context=CONTEXT` should be specified manually along with the environment.
